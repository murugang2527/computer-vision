COMPUTER VISION IMAGE PYRAMID

Observations Pyramid Level Image Resolution Detail Visibility Computation Level 0 High Fine details visible High Level 1 Medium Moderate details Medium Level 2 Low Large structures only Low Level 3 Very Low Very coarse features Very Low

Algorithm

1.Read the input image

2.Convert the image from BGR to RGB format

3.Display the original image (Pyramid Level 0)
Apply pyrDown() to generate Level 1 of the         pyramid

4.Repeat downsampling to generate multiple pyramid levels

5.Display all pyramid levels

6.Observe image resolution changes and detail loss

7.Apply edge detection on each pyramid level for comparison.
